# choices
As E-40 once said: "Everybody got choices." What will you choose?

# TODO
- use a cookie to track user session (or something else besides passing name along the flow)
- CI/CD e.g. use github actions to build a tagged docker image and push it somewhere
- think about testing and act on those thoughts if needed
- get the actual DB model and app flow going e.g. providing multiple choice options for a posed question and rendering actual saved questions
- add a location element when presenting questions for the visitor to answer, that is, present questions based on proximity to user
- have actual login credentials for visitors to the site and associate an alias with each user that can be updated
